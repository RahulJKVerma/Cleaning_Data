## Scripts

The script included is named run_analysis.R. The script uses mostly base R packages except 'dplyr', so it is recommended that dplyr be installed first before running the script.

## Before running

1. Make sure the script is in the 'UCI HAR Dataset' folder.
2. You have read/write permissions on the folder.
3. If you are running a non-unix system, you might have to modify the path of the files in the script by making the '/' to '\'.
